        description: `<h4>Pectoralis major</h4><p>The pectoralis major is a paired, superficial muscle located on the anterior surface of the thoracic cage. The pectoralis major has a broad origin, based on which it is divided into three parts: clavicular part, sternocostal part and abdominal part. All three parts converge laterally and insert onto the greater tubercle of humerus.</p><p>The main function of this chest muscle as a whole is the adduction and internal rotation of the arm on the shoulder joint. Acting independently, the clavicular part helps to flex the extended arm up to 90°, while the sternocostal part facilitates the extension of the flexed arm by pulling it downwards.</p>`,
